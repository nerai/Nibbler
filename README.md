An interactive Turing machine simulator and Busy Beaver calculator using exponential tapes and macro transitions

Busy Beavers are n-state Turing machines which are started on an initially blank tape and produce a maximum number of symbols without entering an infinite loop. This number is called Î£(n) and is easily proved to be noncalculable.

Nibbler aims to provide an easy-to-use framework for working with Busy Beavers.
